**NeuroLibre is a preprint server for interactive data analyses.** It is tailored for publishing interactive 
neuroscience notebooks that can seamlessly integrate data, text, code and figures.

For authors, it takes three steps: ``prepare``, ``test`` and ``submit``
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Our full-fledged (yet simple) submission workflow is designed to help researchers convert a collection of 
Jupyter Notebooks and Markdown files into publishable content. 

Providing online-executable runtimes and a powerful data caching system, NeuroLibre makes a **groundbreaking preprint
server where you can plant the seeds of living publications.**

As an author you should follow:

* :doc:`PREPARE`
* :doc:`TEST_SUBMISSION`
* :doc:`SUBMIT`

For readers, it takes one click!
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
The interactive outputs (such as interactive figures) are readily available in NeuroLibre preprints. Yet, if you'd like
to re-run the analyses and reproduce the outputs, our powerful cloud infrastructure is at the tip of your fingers.

.. seealso:: To find out more about how to navigate a NeuroLibre preprint, you can visit :doc:`READER`.

Contributions are welcome!
::::::::::::::::::::::::::
NeuroLibre is fully open-source and draws its strength from community-developed tools such as `BinderHub <https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub>`_ and `Open Journals <https://github.com/openjournals>`_.
You can find more information under our `github organization <https://github.com/neurolibre>`_.

.. seealso:: If you are interested in contributing to NeuroLibre or to deploy one of your own, please visit `developer documentation <BAREMETAL_TO_BINDERHUB>`_.
