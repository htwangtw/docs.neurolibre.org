.. warning:: NeuroLibre is at an alpha stage of development, and is not currently open for submissions.

1. Prepare submission
=====================

Before submitting to Neurolibre there are several prerequisites that you must complete, those include:

Hosting
:::::::

Github is our main hosting service to store, read and interact with any public submission.
The submission, which is in fact a github repository, will need to be public.

Where our backend supports other git hosting services, our submission workflow doesn't.
Still if you are elligible, you may use `any of those <https://binderhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/repoproviders.html#supported-repoproviders>`_.

.. note:: We are not supporint private repositories at the moment.

Coding language
:::::::::::::::

Neurolibre is living under the jupyter notebook ecosystem, hence supporting a broad range of different coding languages.
If the one you are using is inside `the following list <https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels>`_, then you should be ready to go.
But please be mindful that the administrator and reviewer team mainly focuses on python 3, if you are using another language don't expect fine support for debugging.

We only accept submissions which are in notebook ``.ipynb`` format. Though less recommended, we also support text notebook representation (like markdown)
using `jupytext <https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/formats.html#notebook-formats>`_.

Check the following minimalistic example of a jupyter notebook.

Computation and data requirements
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

NeuroLibre strives to provides the best experience by giving access to lot of ressources, still we have limited hardware.
Taking ressources constraints into account, each submission should:

* not take more than 8 hours to execute uncached (that includes all notebooks and book build)
* run with 1 or 2 CPU@3GHz
* allocate strictly less than ~7.5GB of RAM
* take less than 10GB runtime storage (files generated by your scripts)
* use no more than 5GB of data (inputs, cached content), downloadable from a trusted source

.. warning::  A trusted web source is a well known dataset collection (like `openneuro <https://openneuro.org/>`_)
  or dataset fetching functions from libraries (for ex. `nilearn.datasets.fetch* <https://nilearn.github.io/modules/reference.html#module-nilearn.datasets>`_).

For additional information, our test server (to test and build submissions) uses `Intel Xeon Gold 6248 <https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/192446/intel-xeon-gold-6248-processor-27-5m-cache-2-50-ghz.html>`_,
while the production server (where the final submission lives) has `Intel Xeon E5-2650 <https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/64590/intel-xeon-processor-e52650-20m-cache-2-00-ghz-8-00-gts-intel-qpi.html>`_.
