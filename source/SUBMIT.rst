=========

.. warning:: **A successful book build on RoboNeuro preview service is a prerequisite for submission.**

           Your submission request will go through only if we can find a built preprint on our test server for your preprint repository.

Submission is as simple as:

- Filling in the short submission form at `NeuroLibre web page <https://neurolibre.herokuapp.com>`_
- Waiting for the managing editor to start a pre-review issue over in the NeuroLibre reviews repository: https://github.com/neurolibre/neurolibre-reviews
