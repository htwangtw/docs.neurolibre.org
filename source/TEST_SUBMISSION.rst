2. Test your submission
=======================

Test using roboneuro.

Meet ``RoboNeuro``! Our preprint submission bot is at your service 24/7 to help you create a NeuroLibre preprint.

We would like to ensure that all the submissions we receive meet certain requirements. To that end, we created a `test page <https://roboneuro.herokuapp.com>`_, 
where you point RoboNeuro to a public GitHub repository, enter your email address, then sit back and wait for the results.

.. note:: RoboNeuro book build process has two stages. First, **it creates a virtual environment** based on your runtime descriptions. If this stage is successful, then it proceeds to 
          build a Jupyter Book by **re-executing your code** in that environment. 

- On a successful book build, we will return you a preprint that is beyond PDF!
- If the build fails, we will send two log files for your inspection.

.. warning:: **A successful book build on RoboNeuro preview service is a prerequisite for submission.**

            Please note that RoboNeuro book preview is provided as a public service with limited computational resources. Therefore we encourage you to build your book locally before
            requesting our online service. Instructions are available `here <#testing-book-build-locally>`_.
